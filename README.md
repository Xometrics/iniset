# SnakeGame-MachineLearning-

## Description
A conceptual take on the classic game, Snake, that incorporates a custom AI growing mechanism that will move the snake randomly and continuously learn how to improve chances of survival over time.
- Deployed using Swift in order to create a self-sustaining AI system capable of machine learning.
- Created a custom animation by coding a timer to keep the snake moving  seamlessly.
- The MachineLearning method I wrote will track the current length of the snake and will store the data when the snake dies(gets trapped)
- Not like the actual game the snake will increes it's size by one every 10 movement until it can't move anymore
